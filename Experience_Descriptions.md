# Paragraph Descriptions of Work Experience

## Digital Enterprise Center: 

I am leading a team of two in developing a solution for assembly lines that addresses the risk of foreign objects such as tools or drill bits being left behind, potentially damaging machinery and products. By uptraining the YOLOv8 computer vision model, the program identifies these objects and notifies the operator. To tackle the challenges posed by a short-staffed team, I leveraged multiprocessing image augmentation to generate synthetic data. Additionally, I implemented an automated documentation process using GitHub Actions and Pages, ensuring future developers can easily access and maintain API documentation. As part of the project, I am also building an interactive GUI using Rust, Tauri, and Svelte, which displays camera input from three sources in orthographic projection. This interface allows users to define regions of interest for each camera view, enabling precise foreign object detection by the model.

## Head Teaching Assistant for Advanced and Regular Programming

In Summer 2024, I served as the Head Teaching Assistant for Advanced and Regular Programming at The Harker School in San Jose, CA, where I taught lessons on memory allocation, object and data-type basics, recursion, and coding standards. I also provided guidance to junior TAs by clarifying ambiguous assignment instructions and grading rubrics. Additionally, I led review sessions to help students understand frequently missed test questions and challenging concepts.

## Teaching Assistant for Advanced Programming

During Summer 2023, I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Programming at the same school, tutoring students in object-oriented programming and Java fundamentals while grading exams and projects.

## Investment Analyst Intern

I researched the metaverse and blockchain gaming space, analyzing the nuanced differences in platform designs of industry leaders, and presented these findings to general partners, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each platform. Additionally, I authored two investment memos, providing in-depth analysis on company financials, market opportunities, risk factors, platform/product descriptions, competition, valuations, and company and team histories.
